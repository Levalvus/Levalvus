# README
My name is Andrew Lombardo (Class Of 2027), and I am a Computer Science (Software Development) + Cybersecurity Major
I'm interested in learning front-end development and how to connect networks for them to work in a closed system
Right now I'm working on a research project that uses a machine-learning algorithm to predict and help diagnose sleeping disorders
In my free time, I spend it playing the piano/guitar/bass/producing, listening to music and playing video games
